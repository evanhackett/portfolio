description: My first coffeescript project, and my second Backbone.js project. Fairly self explanatory, this project is a one-player vs AI implementation of the Blackjack card game. Click <a href="http://evanhackett.com/blackjack/">here to play</a> or <a href="https://github.com/evanhackett/blackjack">view on github</a>. It's funny looking back. After completing this project I was convinced coffeescript was superior to vanilla js. Shortly after, the hype train moved to es6 and it seemed coffeescript died overnight!
