description: The Chip8 is an interpreter for a programming language meant to make simple video games. I have always been interested in emulators since I first played with them as a child. This was my first foray into implementing one!  For anyone interested in getting started with emulators, the chip-8 system is commonly recommended as a good place to start. <a href="http://evanhackett.com/chip8/">Click here to play.</a> Or <a href="https://github.com/evanhackett/chip8">view code on github.</a>
