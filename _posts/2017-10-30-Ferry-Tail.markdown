description: Ferry Tail was a site for buying and selling partially used multi-use ferry passes for the islands in the Washington coast area. Read more about the project in these local news articles <a href="http://www.kiro7.com/news/local/new-website-selling-unused-ferry-tickets/362473693">here</a> and <a href="http://www.vashonloop.com/article/discounted-ferry-passes-ferrytailcom">here</a>. The site was built using AngularJS, NodeJS, MySQL, and various other things. At one point I setup a Java server for scanning barcodes out of uploaded pass images, because the javascript libraries for barcode scanning weren't quite good enough. Ferry Tail was eventually shut down by the project owner due to not enough users using the site. It was sad to see my hard work vanish, but I was proud of my work when the project owner told me "The site worked beautifully."
