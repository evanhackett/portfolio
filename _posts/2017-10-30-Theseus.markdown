description: TheseusVR was the final project that my teammates and I completed while attending Hack Reactor. <a href="http://gloryandcode.github.io/Theseus/">TheseusVR</a> is a platform which provides an operating environment for computing in a VR space, allowing users to spin up virtual screens that run 3rd party applications inside of the VR environment. Check out an article about TheseusVR <a href="https://www.hackreactor.com/blog/virtual-reality-platform-built-by-remote-students-opens-possibilities-for-vr-developers">from the Hack Reactor blog</a> to learn more. You may notice in the screenshot that my Chip-8 emulator is running inside the Theseus environment!
